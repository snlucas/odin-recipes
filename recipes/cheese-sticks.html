    <h2>Super-simple Recipe</h2>
    <p>Super-simple breadsticks are easy, cheesy. They're very cool for entertaining.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ (17.5 ounce) package frozen puff pastry</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons olive oil (preferably drained from a tin of anchovies)</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>¼ cup shredded sharp white Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons freshly shredded Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, divided</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat.</li>
        <li>Place a sheet of frozen puff pastry dough onto a floured work surface and allow dough to thaw just until it can be unfolded. Unfold dough into a flat sheet; brush top of puff pastry dough with olive oil. Season with salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle white Cheddar cheese and 1/4 cup Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese onto the dough, covering the surface. Top with a piece of plastic wrap; press cheese and seasonings firmly into the dough with your fingers or by laying a sheet pan onto the dough over the plastic and pressing it down.</li>
        <li>Remove plastic and use a pizza cutter or sharp knife to cut the dough down the seam lines into thirds; cut each third lengthwise into thirds for a total of 9 breadsticks.</li>
        <li>Pick up a dough strip, place it seasoned side down on the work surface, and twist from both ends 8 or 9 times to make a rolled tube of dough with the seasoned side out. Place breadsticks onto prepared baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle remaining 1 tablespoon Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese over the sticks. Roll the sticks lightly to even up their shapes and pick up and press any dropped cheese onto the surfaces.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for about 10 minutes; flip and continue baking until breadsticks are browned and crisp, 10 to 20 more minutes. If you pick up a stick by one end and it droops, bake for several more minutes. Cool on a wire rack before serving.</li>
    </ol>
